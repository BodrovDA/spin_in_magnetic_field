This program generates tau-> (mu->e nu nu) nu nu decay assuming Belle detector condtions (momentum of tau-lepton in the beam center mass system (CMS) and in the laboratory frame).

Tau-lepton decay is generated using Michel parameters notation with possibility to vary them. Muon decay is generated with Standard Model (SM) interaction. Before decay muon propagates in the detector 1.5T magnetic field. The muon spin rotation is taken into account as well as its decay time. 

TODO:

1) add analysis code
2) refactor the code

DONE:

1) change the muon spin direction generation
2) turn on magnetic field
